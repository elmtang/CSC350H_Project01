## Problem Statement and Background
Emulate a game of Elevens, Tens, and Thirteens using abstract classes.

### Elevens
Elevens uses a 10-card board. Pairs of cards whose point values add to 11 are selected and removed, as are a combination of a king, queen, and jack.

### Tens
Another relative of Elevens, called Tens, uses a 13-card board. Pairs of cards whose point values add to 10 are selected and removed, as are quartets of kings, queens, jacks, and tens, all of the same rank (for example, K♠, K♥, K♦, and K♣). 
Chances of winning are claimed to be about 1 in 8 games.

### Thirteens
A game related to Elevens, called Thirteens, uses a 10-card board. Ace, 2, … , 10, jack, queen correspond to the point values of 1, 2, …, 10, 11, 12. Pairs of cards whose point values add up to 13 are selected and removed. Kings are selected and removed singly. 
Chances of winning are claimed to be about 1 out of 2.
