## Problem Statement
Emulate a game of Elevens, Tens, and Thirteens using abstract classes.

### Elevens


### Tens
Another relative of Elevens, called Tens, uses a 13-card board. Pairs of cards whose point values add to 10 are selected and removed, as are quartets of kings, queens, jacks, and tens, all of the same rank (for example, K♠, K♥, K♦, and K♣). 
Chances of winning are claimed to be about 1 in 8 games.

### Thirteens
